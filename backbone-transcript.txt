Greetings everyone !!
For those who don't know me, myself Ankit Arora. I completed 4 years with myProjects them this March. I have worked on various modules and teams namely(Team Core, EPS, Yellow, Blue and now part of Team Orion) 
So lets begin our session.

#Since we have 50 of us in this teams session, In the interest of time we can keep all questions to the end.

1--------------------------------------------------
Starting with the agenda. 
This talk is not about benefits of backbone OR why should we adopt...............Its about Lets make peace with it. We already have it now lets adopt it the best we can.

2018 our goal was to do anything needs to be done accomplish nightly release cycle. Remove:
	- Anything impacting PROD quality.
	- Anything impacting resource productivity.

Increasing awareness about what is in the application and how to use it better.

RECAP

 
10-------------------------------------------------------
On closing note just want to say that:
Javascript the good parts

Jasmine/Mocha are in our projects. Start writing frontend unit test cases and accounting for them in your estimates.
They are integrated with CICD in better way now to get results.

-------------------------Somewhere------------------------------
For the past 2 years, ~90% of my coding time has been spent working on a large scale Backbone.js app
In February 2014, the Backbone community was in a fairly good place. The core library had reached 1.0 the previous year and had a strong team around it. Marionette had emerged as a de-facto standard for web applications

At the time, Backbone would have been a very defensible choice as a library for starting a new web development, as a simpler and more stable alternative to AngularJS , the current “hot” framework.

backbone.Marionette
Backbone.Relational
backbone-forms
backbone.localStorage
Backbone-validation

It is not a pretty picture right now. If you’re part of the Backbone community, I’d love to hear from you on this. Should we be calling Backbone dead and looking to migrate ASAP
